# Contact-based Object Representation Model

We make pretrained checkpoints of our representation model available [here](https://huggingface.co/imm-unicorn/corn-public/blob/main/512-32-balanced-SAM-wd-5e-05-920).

However, if you'd like to generate your own data and/or train your own model,
you can refer to the guidelines in the following subdirectories:

* To pretrain the representation model, follow the instructions inside the [uni](./uni) directory.
* To generate pretraining data, see inside [gen_col](./gen_col) directory.
